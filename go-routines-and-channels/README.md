## What are Goroutines?

Goroutines are lightweight threads managed by the Go runtime. They are much more efficient than traditional threads because:
- They use very little memory (a few KB)
- They are managed by the Go runtime, not the OS
- You can create thousands of them without performance issues

### Basic Goroutine Example
```go
func main() {
    // Start a goroutine
    go func() {
        fmt.Println("Hello from goroutine!")
    }()
    
    // Main function continues immediately
    fmt.Println("Hello from main!")
}
```

## What are Channels?

Channels are the pipes that connect concurrent goroutines. They allow goroutines to communicate with each other and synchronize their execution.

### Basic Channel Example
```go
func main() {
    // Create a channel
    messages := make(chan string)

    // Start a goroutine that sends a message
    go func() {
        messages <- "Hello from goroutine!"
    }()

    // Receive the message
    msg := <-messages
    fmt.Println(msg)
}
```

## Worker Pattern Example

Here's a more complex example that demonstrates a common pattern using both goroutines and channels:

```go
package main

import (
    "log"
    "time"
)

// Worker represents a worker that processes tasks
type Worker struct {
    id int
}

// Task represents a unit of work to be processed
type Task struct {
    id        int
    processed bool
}

func main() {
    // Create channels
    taskChannel := make(chan Task, 5)
    resultChannel := make(chan Task, 5)

    // Start 3 workers
    for i := 1; i <= 3; i++ {
        worker := Worker{id: i}
        go worker.processTasks(taskChannel, resultChannel)
    }

    // Create and send tasks
    tasks := []Task{{id: 1}, {id: 2}, {id: 3}, {id: 4}, {id: 5}}
    for _, task := range tasks {
        taskChannel <- task
    }
    close(taskChannel)

    // Collect results
    for i := 0; i < len(tasks); i++ {
        result := <-resultChannel
        log.Printf("Task %d processed", result.id)
    }
}
```

## Key Concepts Explained

### 1. Channel Types
- **Unbuffered Channels**: `make(chan Type)`
  - Sends and receives block until both sides are ready
  - Perfect for synchronization
- **Buffered Channels**: `make(chan Type, capacity)`
  - Can hold a limited number of values
  - Sends only block when the buffer is full
  - Receives only block when the buffer is empty

### 2. Channel Directions
- `chan T`: Bidirectional channel
- `chan<- T`: Send-only channel
- `<-chan T`: Receive-only channel

### 3. Closing Channels
- Use `close(channel)` to signal that no more values will be sent
- Receivers can check if a channel is closed using `value, ok := <-channel`

## Best Practices

1. **Always Close Channels**
   - Close channels when you're done sending values
   - This helps prevent goroutine leaks

2. **Use Buffered Channels Wisely**
   - Use buffered channels when you know the maximum number of values
   - Helps prevent deadlocks in certain scenarios

3. **Handle Channel Errors**
   - Always check if a channel is closed
   - Use select statements for non-blocking operations

4. **Avoid Goroutine Leaks**
   - Make sure all goroutines can terminate
   - Use context cancellation for long-running goroutines

## Common Patterns

1. **Worker Pool**
   - Multiple workers processing tasks from a channel
   - Great for CPU-bound or I/O-bound tasks

2. **Fan-out/Fan-in**
   - Distribute work among multiple goroutines (fan-out)
   - Collect results from multiple goroutines (fan-in)

3. **Pipeline**
   - Chain of goroutines connected by channels
   - Each stage processes data and passes it to the next
